        make up the genus Nycticebus. They have a round head, narrow snout, large eyes, and a variety of
        distinctive coloration patterns that are species-dependent. The hands and feet of slow lorises have several
        adaptations that give them a pincer-like grip and enable them to grasp branches for long periods of time.
        Slow lorises have a toxic bite, a rare trait among mammals.`
