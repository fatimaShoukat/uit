    What are Pseudo-Elements? <br> A CSS pseudo-element is used to style specified parts of an element.<br> For example, it can be used to:<br> Style the first letter, or line, of an element<br> Insert content before, or after, the content of an element<br>

    <h1>Heading 1</h1>
    <p class="intro1">
        CSS introduces both pseudo- elements and pseudo-classes. A pseudo-element acts like an extra element is in the code. In the case of the :first-letter and :first-line pseudo elements, it is as if there is an extra element around the first letter or the
        first line which can have its own styles applied.
