        JUSTIFY When you have several paragraphs of text, it is considered easiest to read if the text is left-aligned. Justified text looks at the words on each individual line and creates an equal gap between those words. It can look odd if you end up with
        large gaps between some words and smaller gaps between others. This often happens when your lines are not very wide or when your text contains long words.
