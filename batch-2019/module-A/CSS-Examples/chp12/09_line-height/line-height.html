        Leading (pronounced ledding) is a term typographers use for the vertical space between lines of text. In a typeface, the part of a letter that drops beneath the baseline is called a descender, while the highest point of a letter is called the ascender.
        Leading is measured from the bottom of the descender on one line to the top of the ascender on the next.
