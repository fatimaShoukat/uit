<body>
    <span class="bold"> Bold </span> You might wonder why there is a normal weight. This is because if, for example, you created a rule for the <span class="bold">BODY</span> element indicating that all text inside the body should appear bold, you might
    need an option that allows the text in certain instances to appear normal weight. So it is essentially used as an "off switch."
